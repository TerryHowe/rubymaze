# Ruby on Rails Maze

I haven't written a Ruby on Rails application for years, but I wanted to
revisit it for my 3D maze series.  Obviously, there would be better ways
to implement a 3D Maze, but this is more of an exercise in using Ruby
on Rails.

                                  / 
    --+                          +  
      |\                        /|  
      | \                      / |  
      |  +                    +  |  
      |  |                    |  |  
      |  |                    |  |  
      |  |                    |  |  
      |  |                    |  |  
      |  |                    |  |  
      |  |                    |  |  
      |  |                    |  |  
      |  +                    +  |  
      | /                      \ |  
      |/                        \|  
    --+                          +  
                                  \ 
                                   \
